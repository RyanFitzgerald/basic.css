# CSS Project Essentials

This is a simple CSS setup I use for my projects. It comes with a basic grid and initial CSS setup needed for a site, as well as some helper classes I find myself using from time to time. It's meant to be as simple as possible and help avoid the need for any CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation. It also utilizes [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) for style normalization and is built completely on Sass (and can be customized through variables).
